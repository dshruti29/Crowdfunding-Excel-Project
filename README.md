Crowdfunding Data Analysis Project
This repository contains the code and analysis for a crowdfunding data project. The project involves data manipulation, visualization, and statistical analysis in Microsoft Excel.

Project Overview
The objective of this project is to analyze crowdfunding data to gain insights into campaign outcomes, backer behavior, and other relevant metrics. The dataset used in this analysis includes information on crowdfunding campaigns, including their outcomes, goals, categories, and more.

Task Descriptions
The project involved several tasks, each contributing to the overall analysis. Here's an overview of the tasks, along with explanations and justifications for each:

Conditional Formatting
Outcome Column: Conditional formatting was applied to the "outcome" column to highlight different campaign outcomes such as "successful," "failed," "canceled," and "live." This helps in visually understanding the distribution of outcomes.

Percent Funded Column: Conditional formatting was applied to the "percent funded" column to provide visual cues regarding the funding progress of campaigns. It allows for quick identification of campaigns that are closer to their funding goals.

Column Creation
Six new columns were created to enhance the dataset's usability and analysis:
Percent Funded: This column calculates the percentage of the funding goal that has been achieved.
Average Donation: This column calculates the average donation per campaign.
Category: Extracts the parent category from the "category & sub-category" column.
Sub-Category: Extracts the sub-category from the "category & sub-category" column.
Date Created Conversion: Converts the "launched_at" date to a more readable format.
Date Ended Conversion: Converts the "deadline" date to a more readable format.
Pivot Tables and Stacked Column Charts
A pivot table was created to count the number of campaigns with different outcomes per category. This table provides insights into how campaigns perform in different categories.

A stacked column pivot chart was generated with the option to filter data by country. This chart visualizes the distribution of outcomes across categories and countries.

Pivot Tables and Line Graphs
Another pivot table was created to count outcomes based on the Date Created Conversion, allowing for analysis over time.

A pivot chart line graph was generated to visualize the trends in campaign outcomes over time.

Written Report
A written report was prepared to summarize the analysis and draw three key conclusions from the data.

The report also discusses limitations of the dataset and suggests potential additional tables or graphs that could provide further insights.

Crowdfunding Goal Analysis
Calculations were performed to determine percentages for projects that were successful, failed, or canceled based on goal ranges. This analysis helps understand how funding goals affect campaign outcomes.

A line chart was created to visualize the relationship between funding goals and the likelihood of success, failure, or cancellation.

Statistical Analysis
Statistical calculations were performed, including mean, median, minimum, maximum, variance, and standard deviation, using Excel formulas. These metrics provide a quantitative understanding of the data's central tendency and variability.

A brief justification was provided for choosing either the mean or median to summarize the data, explaining the rationale behind the choice.

The analysis of the crowdfunding data provides valuable insights into campaign outcomes, backer behavior, and the impact of funding goals on success. The visualizations and statistical analysis help in understanding patterns and trends in the data.
